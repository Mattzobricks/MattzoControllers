# MattzoControllers

This repository contains the firmware for the famous MattzoControllers.
MattzoControllers are used to automate LEGO and brick train layouts.
All info about these wonderful little gadgets can be found on https://www.mattzobricks.com.

To make editing using VS-Code easier, open the MattzoControllers.code-workspace file, it sets you up nicely.

Enjoy!

Cheers,
Mattze and the Mattzobricks core development team!
